First you may adjust the "TAG"-variable in the Makefile.

Then build the docker image:
    make build

You can start the image using:
    make start

The docker image can have OMD configurations mounted at the volume /omd/sites/demo/etc.
Simply untar the sample configuration from _files/etc.tar.bz2:
    tar xjvf _files/etc.tar.bz2 .

Then you can start the image with:
    make start_vol
